# CY8CKIT-149 BSP

## Overview

Alpha Release Content - Support for PSoC 4 family of devices on ModusToolbox is currently in alpha. Features may change without notice. Contact [Cypress Support](https://www.cypress.com/support) for additional details.

The PSoC 4100S Plus Prototyping Kit enables you to evaluate the PSoC 4100S Plus device and develop with Cypress's fourth-generation, low-power CapSense solution.

To use code from the BSP, simply include a reference to `cybsp.h`.

## Features

### Kit Features:

* World's Most Reliable, Lowest Power CapSense Solution
* On-board Programmer and Debugger

### Kit Contents:

* CY8CKIT-149 PSoC 4100S Plus Prototyping board
* Quick Start Guide

## BSP Configuration

The BSP has a few hooks that allow its behavior to be configured. Some of these items are enabled by default while others must be explicitly enabled. Items enabled by default are specified in the CY8CKIT-149.mk file. The items that are enabled can be changed by creating a custom BSP or by editing the application makefile.

Components:
    * Device specific HAL reference (e.g.: PSOC6HAL) - This component, enabled by default, pulls in the version of the HAL that is applicable for this board.
    * BSP_DESIGN_MODUS - This component, enabled by default, causes the Configurator generated code for this specific BSP to be included. This should not be used at the same time as the CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS component.
    * CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS - This component, disabled by default, causes the Configurator generated code from the application to be included. This assumes that the application provides configurator generated code. This should not be used at the same time as the BSP_DESIGN_MODUS component.

Defines:
    * CYBSP_WIFI_CAPABLE - This define, disabled by default, causes the BSP to initialize the interface to an onboard wireless chip.
    * CY_USING_HAL - This define, enabled by default, specifies that the HAL is intended to be used by the application. This will cause the BSP to include the applicable header file and to initialize the system level drivers.

### Clock Configuration

| Clock    | Source    | Output Frequency |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| IMO      |           | 24.0 MHz         |
| CLK_HF   | CLK_IMO   | 24 MHz           |

### Power Configuration


## API Reference Manual

The CY8CKIT-149 Board Support Package provides a set of APIs to configure, initialize and use the board resources.
